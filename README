Program: PendingBannerReleases
Version: 1.3.0
Author:  Dave Parker (dparker@utica.edu)

1. ABOUT

This program is designed to show the releases in the ESM database which have not
yet been installed in the specified Banner instance.


2. CONFIGURATION

You can configure the connection details for both the ESM H2 database and Banner
database in the config.properties file.  This file must reside in the same
directory as the PendingBannerReleases.class file.


3. RUNNING

If your ESM server is running on Linux, you can simply use the included shell
script (pending_banner_releases.sh) to run the program, like so:

  $ ./pending_banner_releases.sh

Important: You must ensure that both the config.properties file AND the script
are configured properly.  See NOTES (section 5) below.

Alternatively, you may run the PendingBannerReleases class directly.  There are
a few things you must do in order for this to work:

  1. Copy the live H2 database file to a temporary file and ensure that the
     h2.db.file value in config.properties points to the temporary copy.

  2. Specify the H2 and OJDBC drivers in the classpath.

Assuming you have set /var/tmp/ESMAdminProdDb.h2.db as the value of h2.db.file
in config.properties, you would do something like this:

  $ cp /u01/adminApp/ESMAdminProdDb.h2.db /var/tmp/ESMAdminProdDb.h2.db
  $ java -cp <path>/h2-1.4.196.jar:<path>/ojdbc7.jar:. PendingBannerReleases

Where <path> is the full path to the ESM webapp's lib directory
(e.g., /u01/apache-tomcat-8.5.20/webapps/admin/WEB-INF/lib).


4. COMPILING

If you make changes to the source code and need to recompile, you will need to
specify the full path the ojdbc7.jar as the classpath.  Something like this
should work: 

  $ javac -Xlint:unchecked -cp <path>/ojdbc7.jar PendingBannerReleases.java

Where <path> is the full path to the ESM webapp's lib directory
(e.g., /u01/apache-tomcat-8.5.20/webapps/admin/WEB-INF/lib).

 
5. NOTES

  * If you are using the shell script to run this program, you must first ensure
    that the values of h2.db.file in config.properites and ESM_H2_FILE in the
    pending_banner_releases.sh script are the same.

  * The script will copy the live H2 database file to the filename specified by
    ESM_H2_FILE.  So, DO NOT specify the full path of the live file as the value
    for this variable, or the script will fail.

  * This program does not currently recognize dependencies, as I was unable to
    determine exactly how these relationships are stored in the ESM database.
    Therefore, the output may show some product versions which are not installed
    in Banner because they were superseded by a newer release.
